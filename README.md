# Wheel of Concept

*That name sounds really stupid, but I can't help it.*

## About

Wheel of Concept is a small application meant to - as the name suggest - to draw concepts! Actually, it is a simple spinning wheel that has few additional features such as adding custom wheels (which may not even be related to any concepts), saving them locally (with the usage of localStorage) and similar.

## Installation

Since the Wheel of Concept was initally built with the little usage of php (although it is possible to refactor it easily into the non-php app) it needs to be hosted on some kind of server. 

*Note: Main reason to host it on some kind of the server is because this app utilizes js modules, so it's probably not possible to use it easily in the local browser*

## Status

Application is usable, shouldn't contain any glaring bugs and may be further expanded in the future.
